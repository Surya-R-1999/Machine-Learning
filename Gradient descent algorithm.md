# Gradient descent algorithm

1. Setup and Initialization:

A random seed is set to ensure reproducibility.
Key parameters like learning rate, decay rate, and batch size are initialized.
Lists are prepared to store training-related metrics.

2. Training Loop:

The code iterates over multiple epochs, representing passes through the entire dataset.
Within each epoch, the code loops over data batches to perform updates.
The learning rate can decay over epochs to fine-tune learning.

3. Gradient Descent Updates:

Gradient descent updates are performed to adjust the model's slope (m) and intercept (b).
Training and validation Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared metrics are calculated.

4. Results Tracking and Printing:

Parameters like intercept, slope, and loss values are stored for analysis.
Progress is printed periodically, showing the current epoch, loss, and R-squared metrics.

5. Early Stopping Mechanism:

The code monitors validation loss trends using an early stopping approach.
If the validation loss fails to decrease significantly, the training is halted early.
